Mistakes

- Mistakes were made while committing changes. I used past simple tense in commits due to the habit when I just started working on this project.
- While progressing in my code I learned to use present simple tense in commits.
- Initially, failed to document encountered bugs promptly during the coding process.
- Realised the importance of documenting bugs in real-time for better tracking and resolution.
- In future projects, I commit to maintaining a detailed log of encountered bugs and their resolution steps throughout the development process.

[Iuliia Konovalova](https://github.com/IuliiaKonovalova), my mentor, for her invaluable advice and guidance during our online meetings. Her positive and pleasant demeanor instills hope that I am not too old to embark on a career transition and learn new skills.

[Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) tutors and Slack community members for their support and help.

[Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/user/KepowOb) for his amazing CSS tutorials.

A heartfelt thank you to the creators of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for providing an excellent style framework. Their toolkit not only accelerates the development process but also empowers beginners to exceed their own capabilities.

Special thanks to the December offline hackathon, [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/), [SODA](https://www.trustinsoda.com/), which, for a week, made me part of the best team and allowed me to mess up my first README not in my project, but in the one that was at the hackathon.

Special gratitude to the challenges presented by the [COVID](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus) lockdown, which unexpectedly led me to discover the art of bread baking. This experience has become a sincere passion, transforming the process into a form of meditation and a source of approval from my family. 

Special thanks to my [local community in Wales](https://www.caerphilly.gov.uk/), where top-notch bakeries with excellent bread are scarce. Your absence has been a driving force in creating this project, aiming to fill the gap and provide a clear and accessible website for exceptional bread and baking information.
